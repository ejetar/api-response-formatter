## About
A simple and fast ðŸš€ library that displays responses in various formats, according to the Accept header, entered by the user. The library currently displays responses in JSON, XML, CSV, and YAML.

## How it works
The API Response Formatter package provides the developer with a middleware called response_formatter. This middleware takes Response and converts it to a certain format based on the user's request.

In practical terms:
1. Read the contents of the Accept header to know which response format to display to the user.
2. Take the original response content provided by Laravel and convert it to the desired format;
3. Display the response to the user;

### Example 1
```
GET /api/v1/users
Accept: application/xml
```
#### Output
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<xml>
    <item>
        <id>30</id>
        <name>Guilherme</name>
        <surname>Girardi</surname>
        <email>guilhermeagirardi@gmail.com</email>
        <created_at>2019-04-24 20:34:03</created_at>
        <updated_at>2019-04-24 20:34:03</updated_at>
    </item>
    ...
</xml>
```
### Example 2
```
GET /api/v1/users
Accept: application/json
```
#### Output
```json
[
    {
        "id": 30,
        "name":"Acme",
        "surname": "Girardi",
        "email": "guilhermeagirardi@gmail.com",
        "created_at": "2019-04-24 20:34:03",
        "updated_at": "2019-04-24 20:34:03",
    }
]
```

## Installation
First, run: `composer require ejetar/api-response-formatter`

After, add `Ejetar\ApiResponseFormatter\App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class` in `providers` array in `config/app.php` file.

```php
Route::middleware(['cors', 'response_formatter'])->prefix('/v1')->name('api.')->group(function() {
    Route::prefix('users')->name('users.')->group(function () {
        Route::get('me', 'UsersController@me')->name('me');
    });
});
```
